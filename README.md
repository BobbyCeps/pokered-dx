Please see issues.

My process to make this have been to compare the color patched version and the english unpatched version to spot the differences and paste them in the french version while keeping the differences specific to this disassembly project. (while also doing some  manual adjustments to some graphical text stuff)

To say it bluntly i script kiddied hard, i have no actual idea of what im doing, just trying stuff and crossing fingers.

As far as i can see it work, pending actually playing the game fully to find any bugs birthed by this frankensteining.

Granting there was nothing game breaking during my tests (up to getting the pokédex and catching some 'mons), i already have a problem that i explain in the "issues"
I also have the intuition that this issue may hide other problems down the line (box corruption? inventory? league? who know)

Made using those sources :
